# Project Title
Automate-sentiment-analysis-of-textual-comments-and-feedback
# Project Description:
### Project Objective & Brief: 
To develop a deep learning algorithm to detect different types of sentiment contained in a collection of English Sentences or a large paragraph.

# Project Guidelines:
Identify & finalize a collection of English sentences or a large paragraph which will also cover contradictory statements.
Develop a deep learning model for detection & segmentation of sentiments whether positive, negative, or neutral from the paragraph.
Test the model accuracy.
### Expected Project Outcome:
Algorithms to detect different types of sentiment from a paragraph.
Detailed presentation with proof of reasonable accuracy.

# Software Requirements: - 
to Implement the Project:
Google Collab
Python
Java (opt.)
Eclipse
Ubuntu OS (opt.)
# Hardware Requirements: -
1. Processor: A modern multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i5 or higher, AMD Ryzen 5 or higher)
2. Memory (RAM): At least 8GB of RAM is recommended for handling large datasets
3. Storage: Sufficient storage space for storing datasets, model files, and other project-related files. (16GB)
# Functional Requirements
1. Gather a diverse collection of English sentences or paragraphs, emphasizing the inclusion of
contradictory statements.
2. Develop a deep learning algorithm to discern sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
3. Enhance the algorithm to process and reconcile contradictory statements within feedback.
4. Enable the model to segment sentiments within extensive paragraphs or sentences.
# Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: Specify the maximum acceptable response time for sentiment analysis to ensure
real-time or near-real-time processing.
2. Reliability: Define measures to be taken in the event of system failures, ensuring minimal
disruption to service.
3. Availability: Establish the expected uptime and availability of the sentiment analysis system to
ensure it is accessible when needed.
4. Security: Data Privacy: Specify measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with privacy
regulations

In Sentiment analysis, the data mainly focuses on whether the feedback to a product is :
negative
positive
neutral
